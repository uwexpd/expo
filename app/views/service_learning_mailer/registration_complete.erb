1. Get in touch ASAP

Using the link above, identify the orientation contact for your service-learning site. Call or e-mail your orientation contact immediately after registering with the organization. Remember that your organization may work with many different volunteers, so make sure to introduce yourself as a new service-learning student from the University of Washington.

The provided link will allow you to view details for your orientation. Be sure to get in touch with your orientation contact as soon as you register for your placement to ensure you do not miss the scheduled orientation. The orientation should take place by the end of Autumn Quarter. If an orientation time is not listed, you should work with your supervisor to set one up a mutually agreeable time within this time frame.

2. Attend Orientation

Closely review the Orientation Notes of your position description to ensure you go to your orientation prepared and ready to learn. Bring a copy of the syllabus from your service-learning course to the orientation. Community partners are excited to learn about how service fits into your course work. Your commitment to the organization begins at the orientation, and you should leave knowing your schedule for the quarter.

3. Stay Committed Throughout Winter and Spring Quarters

As a UW service-learning student, you are a representative of the University of Washington School of Social Work, the Carlson Center and undergraduate students. Many community partners choose to work with University of Washington students because of their demonstrated professionalism and responsibility as service-learning students, volunteers and interns. We are confident you will continue this tradition. The organization is counting on you to commit to a regular schedule and follow all of their expectations. 

4. Complete Your Evaluation
You will be emailed a link to an online evaluation near the end of each quarter. You must complete the evaluation to indicate that you have fulfilled your commitment to your organization. Please take time to offer thoughtful and detailed feedback to help us improve students' experiences with service-learning. 
We will also contact your site supervisor for an evaluation of your service. This will be available to Carlson Center staff and your course instructor, and will illustrate to your professor whether or not you have met the commitment you made to the organization.

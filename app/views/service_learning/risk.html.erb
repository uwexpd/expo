		<p>Volunteering in the community has its own risks. Your parent or guardian has already read and signed the acknowledgment of risk agreement below, on your behalf. Please read the following statement so that you understand it as well.</p>

		<blockquote>
			<p>I acknowledge there are certain risks inherent in volunteering in the community, including but not limited to physical injury and death.  I acknowledge that all risks cannot be prevented.  I represent that my minor child is physically able, with or without accommodation, to participate in service learning, is able to use the equipment and/or supplies described in the job descriptions for the service learning positions listed on my child’s “Service Learning Opportunities List”, and has obtained the required immunizations.</p>
			<p>Should my minor child require emergency medical treatment as a result of accident or illness arising during volunteer work, I consent to such treatment.  I acknowledge that the University of Washington does not provide health and accident insurance for service learning participants and I agree to be financially responsible for any medical bills incurred as a result of emergency medical treatment.  I acknowledge that my child has been given the option to purchase student insurance through the University.  I will notify the Service Learning staff and staff at my child’s volunteer site in writing if my minor child has medical conditions about which emergency medical personnel should be informed.</p>

StylesheetInclude
=================

This is based upon a helper by Luke Redpath at
http://www.lukeredpath.co.uk/2006/8/21/soundbytes-geddit, but has been
modified to pick up on plugin stylesheet files -- for plugins such as the
pretty_accessible_form plugin which requires its own stylesheet.

For plugin stylesheets, it assumes the stylesheet is named the same as
the plugin.  So, for pretty_accessible_form, the stylesheet would be
named pretty_accessible_form.css.

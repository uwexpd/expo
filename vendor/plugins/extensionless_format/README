ExtensionlessFormat
===================

A plugin written by David Smalley from Litmus (http://litmusapp.com) to help us interface with RESTful XML 
webservices that don't support the .xml extension added by ActiveResource as default.

This plugin so far just defines the :xml_no_extension format to use in your ActiveResource models.


Example
=======

class Something < ActiveResource::Base
  
  self.site = "http://someone:password@an-app.com"
  self.prefix = "/api/"
  self.format = :xml_no_extension
  
end

Calls to Something.find(:all) will now generate http://an-app.com/somethings rather than http://an-app.com/somethings.xml
